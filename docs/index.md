## Project Description

<p style="text-align:justify;">   In the 21st century, human-machine interactions were researched through speech.
Unfortunately, these researches led to a dead-end "because the machine does not understand
the emotional state of the speaker. Thus, researchers have introduced a newer research field
compared to others, emotion recognition" [1]. Emotion recognition is the process of
identifying human emotion [2]. People can have various amounts of success in identifying
human emotions. For computers, emotion recognition involves face detection that leads us to
the computer vision area. Computer Vision is one of the most popular computer science
topics of the last decade. New technologies of computer vision such as face recognition,
defect detection, intruder detection, etc. are highly invested in these days. There are a lot of
applications of emotion recognition. However, there are no significant examples of
multi-person emotion recognition. Our project will focus on that area, combining emotion
recognition with human face recognition in crowded areas.
Furthermore, Horus will also have a deception detection mod. To obtain such
functionality, we will use emotional cues described in psychology articles. Some research
shows that emotional cues can be used as a diagnostic tool to detect deception [3]. We will
use these emotional cues decoded through Horus to detect deception.
This report will contain information about the Horus, its constraints, professional and
ethical issues, functional and non-functional requirements.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">   The goal of Horus is to recognize human emotions from the mimics of their faces. A
camera will rapidly take images/video and Horus will analyze their faces. In single user mode
for Horus to analyze a user's face, there shouldn't be any obstacle, so if the user wears a mask,
hat, etc. Horus will warn the user and will be able to analyze the emotions of the user in real
time besides emotion analysis of a saved video or image. It will report the various emotions
detected from the subject’s face and the intensity of said emotions on a scale. It will also
attempt to detect the mood of the subject from long term analysis of his emotions.
Horus will also have a crowd control mod where it will analyze the emotions of a
group of people such as stand-up, theater or movie audiences to provide feedback to show
organizers who can look at audience excitement and decide which content to keep and which
to discard. A playwright, for example, can look at the reception to specific acts of his play
and decide on which changes to make. As another example, a street artist can place a camera
nearby and get feedback from the Horus according to the emotions of the audience.
Another use case can be handling tension and preventing aggression. For example,
Horus can be used in prison common areas to keep an eye on prisoners. If Horus detects
multiple nervous, angry prisoners and it alerts the guards.</p>
